# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
# Tough. Classes is unfamiliar territory and I don't understand some of the syntax (initilize default vs dynamic, the @ functions). Hardest part is definitely the methods inside classes. I'm bad at them and don't understand what I'm doing. They seem different from regularly defined methods.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
# Fine.
- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
